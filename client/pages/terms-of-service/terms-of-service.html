      <h4>A Note from the Team</h4>
      <p>AdmitHub provides free, expert admissions guidance on our website and via SMS to help students communicate with college admissions offices directly. We created it to give all applicants equal access to information about the admissions process. We ask that you treat our service and community with respect. Spam, personal attacks, and abusive language do not have a place on AdmitHub. If you ever stumble across anything on AdmitHub that looks like it violates our policies, please be sure to let us know.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Accepting the Terms of Service</h4>
      <p>AdmitHub (the “Network”) is an Internet website for questions and answers, owned and operated by AdmitHub LLC (“AdmitHub”) registered in Delaware. Please read these terms of service (“Agreement”) carefully before using the Network or any services provided on the Network or via SMS (collectively, “Services”). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Services. The Services are accessed by You (“Subscriber” or “You”) under the following terms and conditions:</p>
      <br>

      <h4>1. Access to the Services</h4>
      <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AdmitHub may offer to provide the Services, as described more fully on the Network, and which are selected by Subscriber, solely for Subscriber’s own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. Services shall include, but not be limited to, any services AdmitHub performs for Subscriber, as well as the offering of any Content (as defined below) on the Network. AdmitHub may change, suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content. AdmitHub may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict Subscriber’s access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. AdmitHub reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting revised Terms of Service on the Network and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the Network. Subscriber shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Services by Subscriber following such modification constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.</p>

      <p>Subscriber certifies to AdmitHub that Subscriber is an individual (i.e., not a corporate entity) at least 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to or on AdmitHub (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address). Subscriber also certifies that they are legally permitted to use the Services and access the Network, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Network. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Network is revoked in such jurisdictions. AdmitHub makes no claim that the Network may be lawfully viewed or that Content may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If You access the Network from outside the United States, You do so at Your own risk and You are responsible for compliance with the laws of Your jurisdiction.</p>

      <p>AdmitHub will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Network and Services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Network and/or Services will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment. Every reasonable step will be taken by AdmitHub to minimize such disruption where it is within AdmitHub’s reasonable control.</p>

      <p>You agree that neither AdmitHub nor the Network will be liable in any event to You or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Network, the service, any Subscriber Content, or other Content.</p>

      <p>AdmitHub retains the right to create limits on use and storage in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.</p>

      <p>Subscriber shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access the Network or otherwise use the Services, including, without limitation, modems, hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service. Subscriber shall be responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2. Network Content</h4>
      <p>The Network and its contents are intended solely for the use of the Network Subscribers and may only be used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All materials displayed or performed on the Network, including, but not limited to text, graphics, logos, tools, photographs, images, illustrations, software or source code, audio and video, and animations (collectively, “Content”) (other than Content posted by Subscriber (“Subscriber Content”)) are the property of AdmitHub and/or third parties and are protected by United States and international copyright laws.</p>

      <p>All trademarks, service marks, and trade names are proprietary to AdmitHub and/or third parties. Subscriber shall abide by all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services.</p>

      <p>The Network is protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to U.S. copyright laws, international conventions, and other copyright laws. Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Subscriber may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, upload, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, software, materials, or Services in whole or in part.</p>

      <p>Subscriber may download or copy the Content, and other items displayed on the Network for download, for personal use, provided that Subscriber maintains all copyright and other notices contained in such Content.</p>

      <p>Any downloading, copying, or storing any Content for other than personal, noncommercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from AdmitHub, or from the copyright holder identified in such Content's copyright notice. In the event You download software from the Network, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and the data accompanying the software (collectively, the “Software”) is licensed to You by AdmitHub or third party licensors for Your personal, noncommercial use, and no title to the Software shall be transferred to You. AdmitHub or third party licensors retain full and complete title to the Software and all intellectual property rights therein.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>3. Subscriber Content</h4>
      <p>You agree that all Subscriber Content that You contribute to the Network is perpetually and irrevocably licensed to AdmitHub under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license. You grant AdmitHub the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify, create derivative works and store such Subscriber Content and to allow others to do so in any medium now known or hereinafter developed (“Content License”) in order to provide the Services, even if such Subscriber Content has been contributed and subsequently removed by You. Subscriber warrants, represents and agrees Subscriber has the right to grant AdmitHub and the Network the rights set forth above. Subscriber represents, warrants and agrees that it will not contribute any Subscriber Content that (a) infringes, violates or otherwise interferes with any copyright or trademark of another party, (b) reveals any trade secret, unless Subscriber owns the trade secret or has the owner’s permission to post it, (c) infringes any intellectual property right of another or the privacy or publicity rights of another, (d) is libelous, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, hateful, offensive or otherwise violates any law or right of any third party, (e) contains a virus, trojan horse, worm, time bomb or other computer programming routine or engine that is intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or information, or (f) remains posted after Subscriber has been notified that such Subscriber Content violates any of sections (a) to (e) of this sentence. AdmitHub reserves the right to remove any Subscriber Content from the Network, re-post to the Network any Subscriber Content removed by any Subscriber or former Subscriber, suspend or terminate Subscriber’s right to use the Services at any time, or pursue any other remedy or relief available to AdmitHub and/or the Network under equity or law, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Subscriber Content or if AdmitHub is concerned that Subscriber may have breached the immediately preceding sentence), or for no reason at all.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the event that You post or otherwise use Subscriber Content outside of the Network or Services, with the exception of content entirely created by You, You agree that You will follow the attribution rules of the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will ensure that any such use of Subscriber Content visually displays or otherwise indicates the source of the Subscriber Content as coming from AdmitHub. This requirement is satisfied with a discreet text blurb, or some other unobtrusive but clear visual indication.</li>
        <li>You will ensure that any such Internet use of Subscriber Content includes a hyperlink directly to the original question on the source site on the Network (e.g., "https://college.admithub.com/posts/Aq8Xvyuv3qWRqrJuN/p/does-legacy-status-always-help")</li>
        <li>You will ensure that any such use of Subscriber Content visually display or otherwise clearly indicate the author names for every question and answer so used.</li>
        <li>You will ensure that any such Internet use of Subscriber Content Hyperlink each author name directly back to his or her user profile page on the source site on the Network (e.g., http://aboutadmissions.admithub.com/users/username), directly to the AdmitHub domain, in standard HTML (i.e. not through a Tinyurl or other such indirect hyperlink, form of obfuscation or redirection), without any “nofollow” command or any other such means of avoiding detection by search engines, and visible even with JavaScript disabled.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4>4. Restrictions</h4>
      <p>Subscriber is responsible for all of its activity in connection with the Services and accessing the Network. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity or any use of the Services or Content in violation of this Agreement may be grounds for termination of Subscriber’s right to Services or to access the Network. Subscriber may not post or transmit, or cause to be posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation designed or intended to obtain password, account, or private information from any Network or Service user.</p>
      <p>Use of the Network or Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption codes, transfer or store illegal material including that are deemed threatening or obscene, or engage in any kind of illegal activity is expressly prohibited. Under no circumstances will Subscriber use the Network or the Service to (a) send unsolicited e-mails, bulk mail, spam or other materials to users of the Network or any other individual, (b) harass, threaten, stalk or abuse any person or party, including other users of the Network, (c) create a false identity or to impersonate another person, or (d) knowingly post any false, inaccurate or incomplete material.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>5. Warranty disclaimer</h4>
      <p>AdmitHub has no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to Subscriber. Subscriber acknowledges that AdmitHub has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding: which users gains access to the Network; which Content Subscriber accesses via the Network; what effects the Content may have on Subscriber; how Subscriber may interpret or use the Content; or what actions Subscriber may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content. Much of the Content of the Network is provided by and is the responsibility of the user or subscriber who posted the Content. AdmitHub does not monitor the Content of the Network and takes no responsibility for such Content. Subscriber releases AdmitHub from all liability for Subscriber having acquired or not acquired Content through the Network. The Network may contain, or direct Subscriber to sites containing, information that some people may find offensive or inappropriate. AdmitHub makes no representations concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Network, and AdmitHub will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Network.</p>

      <p>Although AdmitHub and the Network will make reasonable efforts to store and preserve the material residing on the Network, neither AdmitHub nor the Network is responsible or liable in any way for the failure to store, preserve or access Subscriber Content or other materials you transmit or archive on the Network. You are strongly urged to take measures to preserve copies of any data, material, content or information you post or upload on the Network.</p>

      <p>The Services, Content, Network and any Software are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. AdmitHub makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the Network, the Services, including any representation or warranty that the use of the Network or Services will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or operate in combination with any other hardware, software, system or data, (b) meet your requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will be corrected, (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

      <p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, AdmitHub disclaims any liability or responsibility for the accuracy, reliability, availability, completeness, legality or operability of the material or services provided on this Network. By using this Network, you acknowledge that AdmitHub is not responsible or liable for any harm resulting from (1) use of the Network; (2) downloading information contained on the Network including but not limited to downloads of content posted by subscribers; (3) unauthorized disclosure of images, information or data that results from the upload, download or storage of content posted by subscribers; (4) the temporary or permanent inability to access or retrieve any Subscriber Content from the Network, including, without limitation, harm caused by viruses, worms, trojan horses, or any similar contamination or destructive program.</p>

      <p>Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to Subscriber.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>6. Third party websites</h4>
      <p>Users of the Network may gain access from the Network to third party sites on the Internet through hypertext or other computer links on the Network. Third party sites are not within the supervision or control of AdmitHub or the Network. Unless explicitly otherwise provided, neither AdmitHub nor the Network make any representation or warranty whatsoever about any third party site that is linked to the Network, or endorse the products or services offered on such site. AdmitHub and the Network disclaim: (a) all responsibility and liability for content on third party websites and (b) any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information) You might be requested to give any third party, and You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against the Network or AdmitHub with respect to such sites and third party content.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>7. Registration and security</h4>
      <p>As a condition to using Services, Subscriber may be required to register with AdmitHub and select a password and profile name. Subscriber shall provide AdmitHub with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, including Subscriber’s e-mail address. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of Subscriber's account. Subscriber may not (a) select or use as a profile name a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (b) use as a profile name a name subject to any rights of a person other than Subscriber without appropriate authorization. AdmitHub reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a profile name in its discretion. Subscriber shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Subscriber's  password. Subscriber is solely responsible for any use of or action taken under Subscriber’s password and accepts full responsibility for all activity conducted through Subscriber’s account and agrees to and hereby releases the Network and AdmitHub from any and all liability concerning such activity. Subscriber agrees to notify AdmitHub immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Subscriber’s account or password. The Network will take reasonable security precautions when using the internet, telephone or other means to transport data or other communications, but expressly disclaims any and all liability for the accessing of any such data communications by unauthorized persons or entities.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>8. Indemnity</h4>
      <p>Subscriber will indemnify and hold AdmitHub, its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, contractors, partners, vendors and service providers (including, without limitation, hosting and telecommunications providers) harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of Subscriber’s access to the Network, use of the Services, the violation of this Agreement by Subscriber, or the infringement by Subscriber, or any third party using the Subscriber's account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>9. Limitation of liability</h4>
      <p>In no event shall AdmitHub, its directors, officers, shareholders, employees, members, agents, consultants, contractors, partners, vendors and service providers (including, without limitation, hosting and telecommunications providers) be liable with respect to the Network or the Services for (a) any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever; (b) damages for loss of use, profits, data, images, Subscriber Content or other intangibles; (c) damages for unauthorized use, non-performance of the Network, errors or omissions; or (d) damages related to downloading or posting Content. AdmitHub's and the Network's collective liability under this agreement shall be limited to three hundred United States Dollars. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to Subscriber.</p>

      <h4>10. Fees and payment</h4>
      <p>Some of the Services require payment of fees. All fees are stated in U.S. dollars. Subscriber shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Network in connection with such Services selected by Subscriber, and any related taxes or additional charges. All fees are non-refundable unless expressly stated otherwise on the Network. Subscriber represents to AdmitHub that Subscriber is the authorized account holder or an authorized user of the chosen method of payment used to pay for the paid aspects of the Services. All fee-based Services and virtual goods are provided “AS IS” with no warranties of any kind. AdmitHub may modify and/or eliminate such fee-based Services at its discretion. Subscriber understands and agrees that the payment for virtual goods grants Subscriber a limited license to use the virtual goods as specified on the Network.</p>

      <p>AdmitHub may change its prices at any time but will provide you reasonable notice of any such changes by posting the new prices on the Network and by sending you email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you may cancel the services prior to the change going into effect.</p>

      <p>For more information about paid services, see Section 15 - Service Agreement below.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>11. Termination</h4>
      <p>Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the other party by any means. AdmitHub may also terminate or suspend any and all Services and access to the Network immediately, without prior notice or liability, if Subscriber breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Upon termination of Subscriber's account, Subscriber’s right to use the Services, access the Network, and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of Your access to and use of the Network and the Services shall not relieve Subscriber of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which Subscriber otherwise may have to AdmitHub or the Network, including without limitation any indemnification obligations contained herein.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>12. Privacy</h4>
      <p>Please review our Privacy Policy, which governs the use of personal information on the Network and to which Subscriber agrees to be bound as a user of the Network.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>13. Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>This Agreement (including the Privacy Policy), as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire agreement between You, the Network and AdmitHub with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. AdmitHub shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond AdmitHub’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Subscriber except with AdmitHub’s prior written consent. AdmitHub may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without Subscriber’s consent. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Subscriber does not have any authority of any kind to bind AdmitHub in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to the Network that is required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon receipt, when sent by confirmed e-mail to info@admithub.com or when delivered in person by nationally recognized overnight courier or mailed by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to AdmitHub, 411 Shawmut Ave #4 Boston, MA 02118, Attn: Legal Dept.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>Due to the unpredictable nature of the college and/or university admissions process AdmitHub does NOT guarantee the successful acceptance into any college or university to which the Student applies and shall not be liable for the outcome of the Student’s admissions application process.   Further, AdmitHub does not warrant or guarantee that any college or university chosen by the Student will be a good fit for the Student or otherwise beneficial for the Student.</p>

      <p>The Subscriber grants AdmitHub the right to save and use Student’s application material as part of a public and deidentified applicant profile. Essays and other materials will be redacted to protect the Subscriber’s and Student’s identity and privacy.  AdmitHub may only display an anonymized version of the Student’s application for the purpose of connecting a student directly with a college.</p>

      <p>The Subscriber grants AdmitHub the right to publish acceptance results on its website and in its promotional materials, with the caveat that no Subscriber or Student name(s) be attached to such results.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>15. Copyright Policy</h4>

        <li>AdmitHub reserves the right, at its discretion, to immediately terminate the account of any subscriber who is the subject of repeated takedown notices.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4>Filing Copyright Counterclaims</h4>
      <p>A subscriber who believes they are the wrongful subject of a copyright takedown notice may file a counter notification with AdmitHub by providing the following items in writing to the Designated Agent at the address below (all received notices will be posted in full to Chilling Effects Clearinghouse):</p>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Upon receipt of a counterclaim, AdmitHub will forward it to the party who submitted the original copyright infringement claim.

      <h4>Use by children</h4>
          
      <p>
        The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13, except in the following circumstances:
      </p>
          
      <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
        <li>
          <p>
            We may collect a child’s name, date of birth, email address or telephone number, and the child’s parent’s email address in order to provide notice to parents that we may contact their child for the purpose of providing the Services that their guidance counselor or teacher has signed up for.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We may collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described below) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
        <li>
          <p>
            If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA. For more information on COPPA, please
            <a href="http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/0493-Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions">click here</a>.
            If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.
          </p>
        </li>
          
        <li>
          <p>
            As a school, district, or teacher providing consent on behalf of parents or guardians, in order to create an Organizer account (as described below) you may be required to provide valid school credentials and a valid school email address to verify your identity in order to access and use certain features of the Services.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:info@admithub.com">info@admithub.com</a>.
      </p>
      <h5>What this is saying</h5>
      <p>
        We care about children’s privacy, and are careful about information collected from students under 13 and how its retained. AdmitHub complies with COPPA, a law created to protect the privacy of minors. You can learn more
        <a href="http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/0493-Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions">here</a>.

      <p>
        Access to and use of the Services itself is free, but in the future, we may offer new or additional special features which AdmitHub may charge for. Therefore, AdmitHub reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain Services. If you want access to those Services, you will pay all applicable fees for those Services, as will be described on the Services. If you continue to use those Services following such notification, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        AdmitHub is free for teachers, students, and educators right now. In order to keep the lights on, we currently charge colleges for necessary text message communication fees and may eventually add fees for high schools (but we don't plan on it). If fees are added in the future, we’ll give you plenty of notice.

      <h4>ADDITIONAL TERMS</h4>

      <p>This Agreement applies to all users of our Services, but there are special terms for you depending on what type of user you are. If you are, for example, a teacher, coach or parent who organizes a “class” or “group” of members, then you are an Organizer. If you are, for example, a student, teammate or parent who is invited to be a member of a class or group by an Organizer, you are a Subscriber. In certain cases, Subscribers may be allowed to invite new members to a “group” to become Subscribers. If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization, such as a school or school district, club, or team, you are an Organization. You may not sign up for or use the AdmitHub Services as someone you are not; AdmitHub may disable or terminate your account if you do so. Please read on below to find out what additional terms apply to you.</p>

      <p>If you are a Subscriber (such as a student, parent, or other individual invited to join a group by an Organizer):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must get your parent or guardian to read and agree to this Agreement before using the Services if you are under 18.</li>
        <li>You will only join classes and/or groups that you have been invited to, or based on your school, class or group affiliation, to which you are a part of.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>If you are an Organization (such as a high school, school district, college or university):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You will only permit staff members (for example, your teachers or guidance staff) who are current employees of your organization to use the Services and to create their own groups. Upon termination of a staff member’s employment with the Organization, you will require such individual to return and cease using all groups he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your organization who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Organization, you will notify AdmitHub immediately by emailing info@AdmitHub.com.</li>    
      </ul>

      <p>If you are accessing the Services as an Organizer (such as a teacher, administrator, or parent creating a group and inviting users to join as Subscribers):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Services may allow you to invite users to join your group(s) and/or to add users to your group(s). IF YOU INVITE OTHER USERS TO JOIN YOUR GROUP, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED CONSENT FROM EACH PERSON THAT YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD TO RECEIVE SUCH INVITATION AND TO RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM ADMITHUB, FROM YOU, AND FROM ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP.</li>
        <li>Organizers can invite members by distributing "Group phone numbers” and communicate with Subscribers, (in some cases, there may be more than one Organizer per group).</li>
        <li>You may only share group phone numbers with Subscribers whom you wish to subscribe to your group. If you plan to broadly or publicly publish these codes, you must manage the accuracy of your subscriber lists carefully.</li>
        <li>Organizers must maintain and monitor Subscriber lists in order to help ensure accurate representation of the Subscribers in your group.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h4>

      <p>There are different ways to use AdmitHub depending on if you’re an educator of guidance counselor (Organizer), a student/parent (Participant) or a college admissions officer. This means that our terms may also be different depending on your role.</p>

      <h5>CONSENT TO RECEIVE PERIODIC MESSAGES FROM AdmitHub</h5>

      <p>As part of the Services, AdmitHub may send communications (such as SMS, emails, and push notifications) to Subscribers of a class group. For example, upon adding a new Subscriber to a class group, such new Subscriber will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the AdmitHub Application. AdmitHub also may inform Subscribers who have not replied that they automatically will be removed from the class group if they do not reply. AdmitHub may send other administrative messages as well. BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM AdmitHub, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH USER YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM AdmitHub AS WELL AS FROM YOU AND ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP. You agree to indemnify and hold AdmitHub harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to your breach of the foregoing.</p>

      <p>To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please follow the instructions below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you are located in the US or Canada, text STOP, CANCEL, or UNSUBSCRIBE:
          <ul>
            <li>in reply to any SMS message from that group,</li>
            <li>to a AdmitHub long-code (a phone number issued by AdmitHub), or</li>
            <li>in the US, to the AdmitHub short code.</li>
            <li>To stop receiving messages from a specific class or group, text UNSUBSCRIBE to your AdmitHub long-code (a phone number issued by AdmitHub), or in the US, to the AdmitHub short code.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</h5>

      <p>We’re letting you know that you may receive messages from us or even from other AdmitHub users, namely your guidance counselor (or your child's counselor) as well as a designated college admissions officer at an institution you have indicated an interest in talking to. If you are an educator or guidance counselor, it’s also important that you get consent from any subscribers before inviting them to join your group. It’s easy for you or anyone else to unsubscribe and stop messages.</p>

      <p>Thank you!</p>
