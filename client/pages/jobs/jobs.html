<h3>Job Description</h3>

<p>AdmitHub is seeking an entrepreneurial, energetic superstar with a deep experience in customer success and higher education to lead our Partner Success team as it rolls out our AI chatbots to colleges and universities across the country.</p>

<h3>About AdmitHub</h3>

<p>We bring the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to higher education through a chatbot-driven text-messaging platform that guides students to and through college.

We also believe in rigorous independent research of our products, especially with respect to at-risk students.
