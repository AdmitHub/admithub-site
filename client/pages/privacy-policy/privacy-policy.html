                </p>

                <p>

                    We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your
                    relationship with AdmitHub, your use of the Services, and for sending you information from us or on
                    behalf of certain third parties. This includes linking you to other members of the AdmitHub
                    community. It also includes providing offers to you based on information you provide or we collect,
                    or your use of the Services. Please review the "INFORMATION COLLECTION" and "HOW WE USE YOUR
                    INFORMATION" sections of this Privacy Policy for a full description of the information we collect,
                    including Personal Information (as defined below), and how we use that information. Remember that if
                    you create a Profile (as defined below) or participate in community forums and similar features on
                    the Services, your information may be public. Note that we do not share your Personal Information
                    with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent; however, we may share your
                    Personal Information under certain limited circumstances. For more details, please review the
                    section below entitled "Information Sharing."
                    We work with network advertisers, analytics service providers and other vendors to serve third party
                    advertisements on and through the Services, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the
                    Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Services; to serve
                    our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us
                    with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For
                    example, if you click on an AdmitHub advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us
                    the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. You may also see
                    third party ads on the Services. The advertisements you see may be served by one or more third
                    parties, who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other web sites and
                    services, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Our ad network providers,
                    the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their
                    own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have
                    access to information about you and your visits to and activity on the Services, as well as on other
                    web sites or online services. Some of these parties may collect Personal Information when you visit
                    the Services or other websites and services. Please review "THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS
                    PROVIDERS" for additional information. Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads
                    participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you
                    used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not
                    opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while using the
                    Services and elsewhere online.
                </p>

                <h5>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h5>
                <p>

                    1. Registration and Other Information You Provide
                    The Services may collect "Personal Information" (which is information that can reasonably be used,
                    alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify or contact a
                    specific individual). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to your name, email address,
                    phone number, physical address or zip code, account information (such as a password or other
                    information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other
                    information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate) and information about your interests and
                    preferences. We will may also collect payment information (typically, credit card or bank account
                    information) if you choose to purchase products or services through the Services. Any information
                    combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.
                </p>

                <p>

                    2. Your Profile, Community Forums and User Content
                    You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, which may
                    include Personal Information, photographs, information about your academic and work history, your
                    interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information ("Profile"). Some of the
                    information in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to everyone, depending on the nature
                    of the information and the privacy settings you choose when you sign in and go to your Account on
                    the website or other Services where you created your Profile. AdmitHub may also make the information
                    contained in your Profile accessible through means other than the Services (such as through an app
                    or an application programming interface (API)). Your de-identified Profile may also be indexed by
                    and displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name. We do not control
                    how frequently third-party search engines update their indexes; consequently their information may
                    be outdated and still available for a period of time even if you discontinue use of the Service.
                </p>

                <p><strong>

                    Note that in order to provide services and opportunities to you, educational organizations,
                    scholarship providers and other third parties may (to the extent permissible by law) be able to
                    review certain information in your Profile for some of the Services, whether or not you have limited
                    public access to that information. You may have the opportunity to control whether this information
                    is shared, but some information may be shared automatically -- all as disclosed on the website or
                    other service where you created your Profile. AdmitHub does not share your contact information
                    (email, full postal address or phone number) with those third parties unless you request or agree to
                    that sharing. However, AdmitHub may send you information and offers from third parties and
                    information about the Services, and you may not be able to opt-out from these messages without
                    closing your account.
                </strong></p>

                <p>

                    The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums,
                    through interactive features and through other communication functionality ("Community Forums"). You
                    may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, suggestions, ideas,
                    questions, answers, comments, testimonials, feedback, messages, images, videos, text or other
                    material ("User Content"). Your User Content may also be posted in your Profile. In addition, if you
                    choose to submit User Content for review or instruction by a counselor at your school, university or
                    working independently, and certain User Content may be publicly posted to the Profile of your
                    counselor, including any Personal Information you included in the applicable User Content. Please
                    think carefully about what you post and before including Personal Information in your User Content.
                    You may edit or remove your Profile information, but you may not be able to remove answers or
                    postings or other uploaded User Content on some Services. To request removal of content you posted
                    publicly on the Services, contact us via email by clicking here. We will honor removal requests
                    received from registered users under the age of 18 or not yet enrolled in a postsecondary
                    institution where required by law. Other removal requests received, may, in our sole discretion, be
                    honored or refused (except that all such requests will be considered in the context of all
                    applicable laws and regulations). In some cases, we may remove only your Personal Information but
                    maintain the rest of your User Content. Note that removal of public postings does not ensure
                    complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted.
                </p>

                <p><strong>

                    Note that anything you post to a Community Forum may be public. If you choose to voluntarily
                    disclose Personal Information in your Profile or a Community Forum, that information will be
                    considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.
                </strong></p>

                <p>

                    In addition, the Services may allow members to communicate and collaborate with each other,
                    including some Services that allow members to engage in one-on-one communication using a chat
                    feature. If you create an account, participate in a Community Forum or choose to communicate with
                    others through the Services, certain information about you may be disclosed in connection with your
                    or others' use of the Services, including certain information about you and your network (such as
                    your name and profile photo, the number of your connections, and the names and pictures of your
                    connections). Our servers may record and we may retain records of the content of any such
                    user-to-user communications.
                </p>

                <p>

                    3. Third Party Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide About You
                    Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third party
                    web site, and you opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information
                    about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.
                </p>

                <p>

                    The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service,
                    such as enabling you to "like" a product within our Services or "share" content to other web sites.
                    If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services
                    to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and
                    the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services.
                    Similarly, if you publicly post information on a third party platform that references AdmitHub or
                    one of the Services, your post may be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that
                    third party. These features may collect your IP address or other Device Identifier, which page you
                    are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the third party feature to function
                    properly. Third party features and applications are either hosted by a third party or hosted
                    directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy
                    policy(ies) of the company(ies) providing it.
                </p>

                <p>

                    You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services
                    (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with another web site
                    or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook
                    applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which
                    you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal
                    Information. Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other
                    users of the Services if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or
                    service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will
                    no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the
                    information previously collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your
                    activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may then collect
                    information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your
                    profile or similar feature with that third party. In some instances, we may require that you
                    participate in the Services through a third party application or feature and, if you choose not to
                    authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you will not be able to use the
                    applicable Service.
                </p>

                <p>

                    The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored
                    by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the
                    third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your
                    choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third
                    party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect
                    information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information
                    previously collected in compliance with all applicable laws.
                </p>

                <p>

                    To the extent permissible by law, we also may supplement the information we collect with outside
                    records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have
                    requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you
                    opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may
                    combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the
                    Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
                </p>

                <h5>4. Referral Features and Gift Certificates</h5>

                <p>
                    The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to
                    use the Services using a one-time email. AdmitHub stores this information for the purpose of
                    verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program. AdmitHub will not use those
                    referred email addresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes to a
                    Service and registers as a user, in which case we may use the email address provided by the referred
                    user in accordance with this Privacy Policy). The referred person may contact us via email by
                    clicking here to request that we remove this information from our active database.
                </p>


                <h5>5. Information AdmitHub Collects Automatically When You Access The Services</h5>
                <p>
                    Like other web sites and online services, we and our analytics providers, vendors and other third
                    party service providers may automatically collect certain "Usage Information" whenever you access
                    and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or
                    school, asking or answering questions, viewing another user's Profile, sending a message, searching
                    for a person or information, or by clicking on a product reward or an advertisement.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, your Facebook ID, your
                    phone number, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search
                    terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the
                    areas within our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the
                    time of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a
                    variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers,
                    to serve advertisements, to select appropriate content to display to you, and to enhance or
                    otherwise improve the Services and our products.
                </p>

                <p>

                    In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device
                    Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you may use to access
                    the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to
                    access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service
                    providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the
                    physical location of the Device used to access a Service, internet service provider (ISP), date and
                    time of your visit, browser language, browser type, referring and exit pages and URLs, amount of
                    time spent on particular pages, which parts of our Services you use, which links you click, search
                    terms, operating system, traffic and related statistics, keywords, and/or other general browsing or
                    usage data.. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a
                    specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.
                </p>


                <p>

                    Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:

                    systems recognize you if you return to our Services shortly after exiting them. Cookies are small
                    text files stored on your computer that allow us to personalize the content of our Services. Cookies

                    <strong>Web Beacons:</strong> We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and
                    other third parties, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web
                    bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is
                    effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
                    and are used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program. In contrast to
                    cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web
                    pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to
                    help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services. We tie the information gathered by
                    clear gifs to our customers' Personal Information.

                <p>

                    <strong>An Embedded Script:</strong> is programming code that is designed to collect information
                    about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily
                    downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and
                    is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
                    In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for
                    security and fraud detection purposes.

                <p>

                    <strong>Flash & HTML5:</strong> We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content,
                    information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our
                    site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 & Flash
                    to collect and store information.
                    Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs

                    <strong>How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals:</strong>
                    Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT)
                    signal to websites and online service you visit. DNT is a privacy preference that users can set in
                    certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about
                    their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, we do not
                    recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the internet industry is still working to
                    determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding
                    to DNT. To find out more about "Do Not Track", please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

                    Note that we may create, facilitate or display social advertisements, whereby your name and profile
                    photo may be used to advertise products and services to your network based on your use of the
                    Services and your interactions with AdmitHub and third parties through the Services (a "Social Ad").
                    If we are utilizing Social Ads on one of our Services, you will be able to opt-out through your
                    account settings for that Service.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Please note that information submitted on the Services via a "Contact Us" or other similar function
                    may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided via these functions to contact

                </p>

                <h5>INFORMATION SHARING</h5>
                <p>

                    AdmitHub does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes
                    without your consent and in compliance with all applicable laws (including California Business &
                    Professions Code section 22584 ("SOPIPA"), and California Education Code section 49073.1). AdmitHub
                    may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate or de-identified user statistics, demographic
                    information and Usage Information with third parties, including advertisers, content providers, and
                    analytics providers; and third parties may collect non-Personal Information when you visit the
                    Services. We also may share your Personal Information with third parties with your consent (if
                    permissible under applicable law), as disclosed at the time you provide us with information, and as
                    described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy:
                </p>

                <p>

                    <strong>1. Educational Institutions:</strong> We work with colleges, universities, scholarship
                    providers and educational institutions ("Educational Institutions") to provide targeted recruiting
                    and outreach to some of our members. For some of our Services, we may allow Educational Institutions
                    to review information in your Profile (such as hometown, grade point average, and graduation year),
                    whether or not you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that information. We do not
                    share your contact information (email address, full postal address or phone number) with these
                    Educational Institutions without your consent, but we may send you information on their behalf. This
                    is a fundamental element of some of our free Services. In addition, you may indicate that you would
                    like to receive additional information from Educational Institutions or other third parties and we
                    will then share your information with those parties so that they may contact you per your request.
                    We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties. If you later decide
                    that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that
                    third party directly.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <strong>2. When You Request That We Share Your Information:</strong> In compliance with all
                    applicable laws, we may offer opportunities and features through the Services that are brought to
                    you by a third party or that otherwise involve sharing your information with a third party. If you
                    request or agree at that time to have your information shared, your information will be disclosed to
                    that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third
                    party. This includes, without limitation, instances in which you use our Services to purchase
                    products or services provided, in whole or part, by third parties, such as when you use our Service
                    to order food from a local restaurant. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an
                    interactive feature, a widget or third party application, that we share information about you with a
                    third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <strong>3. Service Providers.</strong> We will share your Personal Information with third parties to
                    provide services to us or you in connection with the Services, but subject to confidentiality
                    obligations which limit their use and disclosure of such information. For example, we may provide
                    your Personal Information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
                    activities, such as shipping your order, sending our emails, or offering customer service. If you
                    purchase any products or services, our billing partner will receive billing and financial
                    information (e.g., credit card numbers) necessary to process your charges, including your phone
                    number, postal and e-mail addresses, depending on your payment method.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <strong>4. Administrative, Legal Reasons & Academic Integrity Investigations.</strong> We may also
                    disclose your information, including Personal Information, in response to a subpoena, court order,
                    or when otherwise required by law; in response to bankruptcy proceedings; to defend our rights; in
                    response to a request from law enforcement; to provide information to a claimed owner of
                    intellectual property who claims that content you have provided to us infringes on their rights;
                    upon request of an academic institution connected to an investigation into academic integrity; to
                    protect and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Services; or
                    to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual. We
                    may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to identify users, and may do so in
                    cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law
                    enforcement agencies in our discretion. These disclosures may be carried out without your consent or
                    without notice to you.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <strong>5. Business Transitions.</strong> AdmitHub may share Personal Information with its parent,
                    subsidiaries and affiliates, and investors primarily for business and operational purposes so long
                    as any recipient agrees to comply with this Privacy Policy and applicable law with regard to such
                    Personal Information. In the event that AdmitHub goes through a business transition, such as a
                    merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, bankruptcy, or
                    other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence
                    process, your information, including Personal Information, will likely be among the assets
                    transferred. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on Services of any completed
                    change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have
                    regarding your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy will become binding upon the new owner of
                    the information until amended.
                </p>

                <h5>THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS</h5>
                <p>

                    We work with network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors to
                    serve third party advertisements on and through the Services; to provide us with information
                    regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when
                    visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other websites, within mobile apps, and
                    elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the
                    effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on an AdmitHub advertisement, our
                    service provider(s) may be able to tell us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were
                    viewing the advertisement; likewise, if you click on an ad you see on our Services, our service
                    provider(s) may be able to tell which page you were visiting on our Services and pass that
                    information to the advertiser. The advertisements you see may be served by one or more third
                    parties, who may use information collected over time about your activities on the Services, and
                    other websites and services, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
                    Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that
                    allows you to opt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may access that
                    opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may
                    continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere online. We may share Usage
                    Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other
                    vendors. Our ad network providers, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and
                    other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and
                    they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your online browsing
                    activities. Some of these third parties may collect Personal Information over time when you visit
                    the Services or other web sites and services.
                </p>

                <p>

                    If you use the Services through a mobile device or one of our mobile applications, it may be

                    location to AdmitHub; however, AdmitHub will not track such information in the background. If you
                    transmit such information to AdmitHub, we may store or use that information in compliance with this
                    Privacy Policy.). You may be able to opt-in to receiving text messages from AdmitHub. You may always
                    opt-out by replying “#pause” or "STOP" to one of the text messages received. You also acknowledge
                    and agree that use of the Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and
                    through your mobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access provider.
                </p>

                <p>

                <h5>Push Notification:</h5> We will send you push notifications if you agree to receive them. You may
                opt-out of receiving these at any time by going to the phone settings and turning them off.
                </p>

                    Services. If you no longer want to receive information from us, you will need to close your account
                    for that Service.

                    may not be made through this email address, but rather must be submitted through one of the channels
                    set out in the previous section.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup or archive records and we may
                    retain certain data relevant to preventing fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business
                    purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable or de-identified data, account
                    recovery or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the applicable
                    privacy policy for the Service. Also, if you have posted content on or through the Services, we may

                <h5>THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER SITES, AND ADMITHUB CONTENT FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES</h5>
                <p>

                    Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third parties, which may
                    include third party widgets (such as those that allow you to "like" or "share" content with third

                    <div>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California
                        have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all
                        third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information
                        during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes and the categories
                        of personal information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a company
                        that has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing
                        personal information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes
                        may instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. AdmitHub qualifies for the
                        alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that AdmitHub provides
                        you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing
                        purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time AdmitHub offers that choice,
                        AdmitHub does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing
                        purposes.
